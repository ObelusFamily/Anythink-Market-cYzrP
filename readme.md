# Welcome to the Anythink Market repo

To start the app use: `./start.sh`, it'll start both the backend and the frontend.
Make sure you run `yarn install` first.

Also put in .env:
- in the backend the mongo url
- in the frontend the right port (3001)

Please find more info about each part in the relevant Readme file ([frontend](frontend/readme.md) and [backend](backend/README.md)).

## Development

When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, please create a new pull request against `main` from a feature/bug branch and add `@vanessa-cooper` as reviewer.
